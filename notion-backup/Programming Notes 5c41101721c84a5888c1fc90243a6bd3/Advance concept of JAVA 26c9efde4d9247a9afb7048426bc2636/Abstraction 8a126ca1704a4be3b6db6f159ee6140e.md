# Abstraction

Abstraction is an oops principle. Abstraction means focusing only on what
is important.

Examples scenarios :

- If you want to travel from San Jose to San Francisco, you will need a
car. Now you are going to ask for a car for this and not a specific car
like Ferrari or Audi.
- If your goal is to stop the car while driving you are going to apply
brakes, now here you wonâ€™t care about the specifics like what
happens when you apply brakes or how brakes work.

### How can abstraction be achieved in java?

- Abstract classes and methods
- Interfaces

### What is an abstract class and abstract method?

Abstract class is a class that is declared as abstract using abstract
keywords. Abstract methods are methods without its body.
Points to remember about abstraction.

- Abstract classes and objects can be declared using abstract keyword
- If you declare a single method as abstract in a class, you have to
declare the class as abstract.
- Whenever a class extends an abstract class it has to provide the
definition of the methods declared in parent class as abstract

```java
public class Audi extends Car{
    @Override
    void accelrating() {
        System.out.println("Audi accelrating");
    }

    @Override
    void breaking() {
        System.out.println("Audi breaking");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Ferrai extends Car{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }

    @Override
    void accelrating() {
        System.out.println("Ferrai accelrating");
    }

    @Override
    void breaking() {
        System.out.println("Ferrai breaking");
    }
}
```

```java
abstract class Car {
    String name;
    int tyres;
    String colors;

    abstract void accelrating();
    abstract void breaking();
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Ferrai();
        car.breaking();
        car.accelrating();

        car =new Audi();
        car.breaking();
        car.accelrating();
    }
}
```

```java
Output:
Ferrai breaking
Ferrai accelrating
Audi breaking
Audi accelrating
```
