# Inheritance

1. Inheritance is a process in java using which one class acquires the property
of another class in java and object oriented programming. 
2. Class whose properties are getting acquired is known as super class / base class /
parent class and class who is acquiring the properties is called child class /
sub class

### Point to remember in Inheritance

- You can inherit parent class by using extends keyword in java
- On inheritance, all the methods and variables (which are not declared
as private) from the parent class are inherited by child class in java.
- You can call methods from the parent class using child class object
using dot(.) operator

```java
Syntax :
class <child-class> extends <parent-class>{
}
```

```java
public class Animal {
    int legs=4;
    public void walk(){
        System.out.println("Walking");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Dog extends Animal{
    public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Braking " + legs);
    }
}
```

```java
public class inheritance{
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog dog = new Dog();
    dog.walk();
    dog.bark();
}
}
```

```java
Output:
----------------
Walking
Braking 4
```
