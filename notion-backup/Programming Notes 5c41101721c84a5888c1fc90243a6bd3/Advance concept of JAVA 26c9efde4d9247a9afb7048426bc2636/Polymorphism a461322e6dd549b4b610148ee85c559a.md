# Polymorphism

- Polymorphism is a greek word where poly means many and morphism
means behaviour. So polymorphism is nothing but the ability of an object to
exhibit different behaviour.
- There are 2 types of polymorphism
● Compile time polymorphism / static binding / early binding
Example : overloading
● Run time polymorphism / dynamic binding / late binding
Example : overriding

## Overloading

1. Method Overloading 
    1. Method overloading is a feature in java that allows us to declare methods
    with the same name but different parameters.
    
    ```java
    public class OverloadingMain {
    // Overloaded method
        public void add() {
            System.out.println("Output : " + 2);
        }
    
        public void add(int a) {
            System.out.println("Output : " + (a + a));
        }
    
        public void add(int a, int b) {
            System.out.println("Output : " + (a + b));
        }
    
        public void add(int a, String b) {
            System.out.println("Output : " + " : " + a + b);
        }
    
        public void add(int a, int b, int c) {
            System.out.println("Output : " + (a + b + c));
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
    
            OverloadingMain overloadingMain = new OverloadingMain();
            overloadingMain.add();
            overloadingMain.add(2);
            overloadingMain.add(2, 3);
            overloadingMain.add(2, 3, 5);
            overloadingMain.add(2,"Test");
    
        }
    }
    -----------------
    Output:
    Output : 2
    Output : 4
    Output : 5
    Output : 10
    Output :  : 2Test
    ```
    
    1. Constructor Overloading 
        1.  Constructor overloading is a feature in java which allows us to define
        multiple constructors for same class with different no. of arguments or
        same no. of arguments and different data type.
        
        ```java
        public class OverloadingMain {
        
            public OverloadingMain(){
                System.out.println("Constructor with no parameters called");
            }
        
            public OverloadingMain(int a){
                System.out.println("Constructor with one integer parameter called");
            }
        
            public OverloadingMain(int a, int b){
                System.out.println("Constructor with 2 integer parameters called");
            }
        
            public OverloadingMain(int a, String a1){
                System.out.println("Constructor with 1 integer and 1 String called");
            }
        
            public static void main(String[] args) {
        
                new OverloadingMain();
                new OverloadingMain(3);
                new OverloadingMain(1,3);
                new OverloadingMain(1,"Name");
        
            }
        }
        -------------------------
        Output:
        
        Constructor with no parameters called
        Constructor with one integer parameter called
        Constructor with 2 integer parameters called
        Constructor with 1 integer and 1 String called
        ```
        
    2. Operator Overloading 
        1. C++ supports operator overloading where in you can define the behaviour
        of the operator. Example you can define the behaviour of + operator in java
        explicitly. J
        2. ava does not allow you to explicitly define the behaviour of any
        operator but java has implicitly overloaded + operator which will exhibit
        different behaviour based on the kind of arguments you pass to it.
        
        Note:
        
        If you use + operator with two integers it will perform addition, however if
        you use + operator with two string operands it will perform concatenation.
        

```java
public class OverloadingMain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(10 + 20);
        System.out.println("Hello " + "Java");
        System.out.println("Hello " + "Java " + 10);
        System.out.println("Hello " + "Java " + 10 + 30);
        System.out.println("Hello " + "Java " + (10 + 30));
    }
}
---------------
Output:
30
Hello Java
Hello Java 10
Hello Java 1030
Hello Java 40
```

## Overriding:

- Every child class in java has access to non-private methods defined in
parent class. There might be scenarios where you might want the same
method in parent class to behave differently in child class. This is where the
concept of overriding kicks in.
Method overriding allows you to override the definition of method defined in
parent class with new definition.
Things to keep in mind for overriding a method
● Method overriding can only happen when there is inheritance
relationship
● Method in parent class is known as overridden method and method in
child class is known as overriding method
● Signature of method in parent class and child class should be same
for overriding to take place
● You can use @override keyword in child class when overriding,
compiler will highlight mismatch in syntax for overriding method with
overridden method

### Method Overriding

```java
class A {

    // Overridden method
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display of class A");
    }
}

class OverridingMain extends A {

    // Overriding method
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display of class OverridingMain");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OverridingMain overridingMain = new OverridingMain();
        overridingMain.display();
    }
}
------------
Output:
Display of class OverridingMain
```
