# Object Oriented Programming

## Four important pillars of OOPs.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information.
 Eg : Calculator and Car

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users. The user need not worry about internal details and complexities of the system. Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and the code, that operate on the data into a single entity.

Eg : Laptop and Tablet capsule 

### Inheritance

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.

Eg:

### Polymorphism

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

- Types of Polymorphism
    - Compile time polymorphism
    - Runtime Polymorphism
- Compile-time polymorphism
    
    It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of
    Polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. But Java doesnâ€™t support the Operator Overloading.
    
    - Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different
    parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.
- Runtime Polymorphism
    
    It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in
    which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of
    polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.
    
    - Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one
    of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
