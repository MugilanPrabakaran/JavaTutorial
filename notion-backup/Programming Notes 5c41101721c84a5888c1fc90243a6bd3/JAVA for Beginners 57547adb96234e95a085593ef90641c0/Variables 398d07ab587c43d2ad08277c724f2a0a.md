# Variables

1. Basically it is used for assign a value 

```java
int age = 27;

```

1. Here age is an variable name and 27 is a value assigned to the variable 
2. Any variable if you declared inside the method it will be available only inside the method
3. If you declare two same variable inside method it will throw error like below
    
    for eg:
    
    ```java
    class HelloWorld {
      public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
        int age = 27 ;
    
        int age = 28 ;
        System.out.println ( " I am " + age + "years old . " ) ;
    	}
    }
    -----------------------
    Output:
    int age =28;
            ^
    1 error
    exit status 1
    java: variable myAge is already defined in method main(java.lang.String[])
    ```
    
4. Declaring  the variable inside a class will be available in the class alone 

```java
class HelloWorld {
	static int age = 27;
  public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
    System.out.println ( " I am " + age + "years old . " ) ;
	}
}
```

1. Whenever declare a variable in a class level the java compiler assign the default value to it and the default value is zero

```java
class HelloWorld {
	static int age ;
  public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
    System.out.println ( " I am " + age + "years old . " ) ;
	}
}

Output:
-------------------
I am 0years old.
```

1. If you redeclare the age variable inside the method ,it will take method variable.  as long as they are not declared within the same code block you are good to go. 

```java
class HelloWorld {
	static int age ;
  public static void main ( String [ ] args ) {
		int age =27;
    System.out.println ( " I am " + age + "years old . " ) ;
	}
}
-------------
Output:
I am 27years old.
```

1. Naming convention of variables 
- Don’t start variable with numbers
    
    ```java
    int 6age;
    ```
    
- Don’t  give space with variables
    
    ```java
    int my age;
    ```
    
- Use camel case
    
    ```java
    int myAge;
    ```
    
- Avoid naming variables using single letters
    
    ```java
    int a;
    ```
    
- There are 50 keyword used in java don’t use keywords as names
